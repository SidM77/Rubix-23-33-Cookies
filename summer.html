            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">What Should You Plant in the Summer?</span> <br>
            Summer crops thrive in sunny climates. They require warm soil and mild temperatures to blossom. Frost damages
            and kills summer plants. <br><br> 

            <img src="pumpkin.jpg" style="margin-left: 7rem; height : 27rem; width : 40rem;"> <br><br>
    
            Summertime plants should be planted after the last frost of the spring. Some of the best fruits and vegetables
            for your summer garden include: <br><br>
    
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Corn <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Cucumbers <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Melons <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Peppers <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Tomatoes <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Okra <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Eggplants <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Grapes <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Red cabbage <br><br>
            Cool-season plants grow better in average temperatures. They don't require as much moisture or sunlight as
            summer crops. <br><br>
    
            Cool-weather crops include beets, carrots, broccoli, and spinach. These vegetables can be planted late-summer
            and harvested during the fall. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Grow Hearty Summer Crops</span><br>
            Once you've decided which plants to farm this summer, it's time to get gardening. We've listed 10 tips to help
            you get the most out of your crops this season. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">1. Get a Head Start</span> <br>
            Get ahead of the gardening game by starting your first round of crops indoors. If you're worried about a
            last-minute frost, use small flower beds to sow your seeds. <br><br>
    
            Keep your plants next to windows during the day to soak up early springtime sunshine. Use artificial lights to
            produce warmth and stimulate growth. <br><br>
    
            The best crops to grow indoors are hardy ones. Stick with herbs, spices, and resilient greens, like kale. They
            can withstand cooler temperatures better than other plants. <br><br>
    
            Once spring has officially sprung, transplant your indoor greens to your outdoor garden. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">2. Prep the Soil</span> <br>
            Before you plant your seeds, you must prepare their home. Soil prep should start two to three weeks before you
            plant. <br><br>
    
            Start by testing the soil's pH level. Most plants need the dirt to be neutral to slightly acidic. <br><br>

            <img src="soil.avif" style="margin-left: 7rem; height : 27rem; width : 40rem;"> <br><br>
    
            Use a spreading fork or rototiller to loosen the soil. Spread manure or compost three to four inches deep. Mix
            in any extra fertilizers. <br><br>
    
            Once the bed is level, water your soil. Keep an eye on your gardening beds over the next few weeks. <br><br>
    
            Before you plant, check the soil's temperature. The soil needs to be warm enough for your summer plants to
            thrive. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">3. Prune Wisely</span>  <br>
            Pruning is when a gardener selectively eliminates part of a plant. It's commonly applied to roots, buds, or
            branches. <br><br>
    
            Pruning improves air circulation. It enables plants to grow a particular direction, removes dead sections, and
            boosts the quality of its remaining flowers. <br><br>
    
            As your summer crops grow, prune away any diseased parts, like yellow leaves. You can use your thumb and
            forefinger to pinch off a small part of the plant. For bigger crops, gardening shears work. <br><br>
    
            Prune early in the day when the plant is dry. Try not to remove large sections of the plant. This may cause
            injury or interfere with the plant's ability to shade itself. <br><br>
    
            Some gardeners have mixed emotions regarding pruning vegetables, especially tomatoes. But when done in small
            doses to keep the plant clean and healthy, it leads to luscious fruits and veggies. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">4. Try Trellising </span><br>
            A trellis supports plants to grow up instead of out. It keeps plants off the ground and increases space in your
            garden. Trellises prevent crops from sitting in soil and rotting. <br><br>

            <img src="tomato.jpg" style="margin-left: 7rem; height : 27rem; width : 40rem;"> <br><br>
    
            Crops that respond the best to trellising are: <br><br>
    
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Tomatoes <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Beans <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Berries <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Melons <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Peas <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Squash and pumpkins <br>
            <b>•</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Cucumbers <br><br>
            Depending on the weight of the vegetable, the type of trellis you design may vary. Cucumbers require more sturdy
            materials to hold their weight. Berries, on the other hand, can grow on a small wooden trellis. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">5. Start Staggering</span> <br>
            Instead of planting all of your crops at once, stagger them. Plant the same crop every few weeks. This produces
            a continuous harvest throughout the summer. <br><br>
    
            Staggered, or succession, planting protects your crops from bug infestations and disease. If one round of crops
            is wiped out, you can rely on your next batch to be better. <br><br>
    
            Gardeners find staggered planting is best used for squash, cucumbers, and beans. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">6. Partner up Your Plants</span> <br>
            Different plants mature at different rates. Companion planting groups slow-maturing crops with fast-growing
            ones. <br><br>
    
            As the fast-maturing crop develop, they can be harvested sooner than their partner crop. Once the matured crop
            is picked, the slow-maturing ones can spread out and grow. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">7. Harvest and Replace</span> <br>
            Watch your plants grow and harvest them as soon as they're ready. The longer your fruits and veggies sit in your
            garden, the more likely they'll be eaten by deer, insects, or birds. <br> <br>
    
            Once one crop is harvested, replace it with another. As you reach the end of the summer, replace summer crops
            with fall ones. This keeps your garden booming up until the first snowfall. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">8. Keep the Family Together</span> <br>
            Create an entire bed dedicated to one crop family. Label your bed for your own organization. <br><br>

            <img src="corn1.jpg" style="margin-left: 7rem; height : 27rem; width : 40rem;"><br><br>
    
            This makes it easy to rotate the beds and plan staggered cropping. Similar crops require the same type of care
            and fertilizer. They'll often mature around the same time, so you can replace the entire bed with the next round
            of seeds. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">9. Raise Your Beds</span> <br>
            If you don't want your garden directly on the ground, raise your beds. This adds aesthetic appeal to your
            garden. They make it easier to pick vegetables and fruit as they require less back strain. <br><br>
    
            Raised beds control roots and weeds from taking over your garden. They'll make your garden look more organized
            and prevent it from growing into your pathway. <br><br>
    
            Raised beds provide better drainage and prevent soil compaction. If you live in an area where heavy rainfall is
            frequent, raised garden beds stop your soil from washing away. <br><br>
    
            <span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">10. Grow Your Knowledge</span><br>
            As a gardener, there's always room to grow (excuse the pun). Keep yourself educated by following farming blogs
            and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. <br><br>
    
            Throughout the summer, pay attention to weather patterns. Severe thunderstorms, hurricanes, or tornadoes
            threaten your summer crops. If a bad storm is coming, try putting a tarp over your beds to keep your fruits and
            veggies safe. <br><br>
