    <h1 class="header1">Winter Guide</h1>
    <div class="content">
        Our country is a multiseasonal land with different climates across the map, and now, the monsoon is slowly
        waning away. <br><br>

        While the southern peninsula doesn’t experience much of winter climate, the central, and especially the northern
        region goes through a massive change for a few months.<br><br>

        It is remarkable to note that farmers, who are growers by profession, are the primary cogs to producing crops
        for the whole country.<br><br>

        Some regions that go through heavy monsoon conditions still need to be cautious for the coming winter. They need
        to continue to prepare and examine the coming weather so that they can have a successful harvest by the end of
        the season.<br><br>

        Since most of the farmers in our country got into the agriculture business through the family, they have plenty
        of knowledge of these changing seasons.<br><br>

        But, there is always more room to grow, and for everyone to learn something, farmer or not, it is quite
        illuminating when you get to know how our country’s farmers deal with the crops that are eventually being served
        to you as food.<br><br>

        Here are some important tips to make sure that you and your farm are more than just ready for the coming winter.<br><br>

        <span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">01. Winter Gear</span><br>
        Check the weather forecasts, talk to your fellow farmers, maybe go through some climate monitoring data. Analyze
        the winter conditions in your region and prepare accordingly.<br><br>

        If you are in the mountainous areas and experience snowfall, make sure you have all the gear that you need to go
        through snowy days.<br><br>

        And in case your region has no snowfall but still has its cold and dry months, gather up all the warm wear and
        tools from your storage.<br><br>

        <span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">02. Maintenance Check</span><br>
        It’s that time yet again!<br><br>

        A thorough maintenance check to all your farm tools, equipment and your beloved tractor.<br><br>

        If you are going to cultivate during cold climatic conditions, it is important to inspect all your farm
        equipment and keep them well maintained.<br><br>

        The tools should be cleaned and greased if necessary. Your equipment should be recharged, and your tractor
        should go through oil and engine checks.<br><br>

        You can also stock up on some fluids if you ever need them on a cold start.<br><br>

        <span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">03. Dry Storage Shed</span><br>
        Winter mornings are cold and also damp. Leaving your equipment out in the open will damage it and shorten their
        lifespan from the dampness.<br><br>

        Your farm must have a shed if it doesn’t yet. Make sure to clean the shed itself and keep it dry, so that you
        can store your equipment, seeds, crops, fluids, and some other farm related items such as fertilizers and
        storage bins.<br><br>

        The sun takes its time to rise during the winter. Keeping a shed will not only secure your inventory, but it
        will also be easier to navigate them.<br><br>

        <span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">04. Soil Preparation</span><br>
        Dry winters can parch the soil. Making use of nutrient-rich fertilizers will enhance the soil and help with crop
        development throughout the winter season.<br><br>

        <img src="raddish.jpg" style="margin-left: 7rem; height : 27rem; width : 40rem;"> <br><br>

        You must consult with other experienced farmers or experts about suitable fertilizers for your specific region,
        so that you can appropriately take measures to keep your soil healthy for cultivation.<br><br>

        <span style="font-size: 2.5rem;">05. Animal Shelter</span><br>
        Most farmers have at least one or two farm animals (usually cows) if not a whole herd.<br><br>

        Just like us, animals also require adjusting to the changing seasons, and a barn would be adequate to keep them
        protected from the chilly winds of winter.<br><br>

        This way, they can remain healthy and happy while continuing their farm duties.<br><br>

        Winters can be harsh, but they are also more manageable if you can measure and track the coming changes.<br><br>
